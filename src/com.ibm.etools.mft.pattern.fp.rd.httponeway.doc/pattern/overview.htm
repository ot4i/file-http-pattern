        <p>Your pattern is a reusable solution that encapsulates a tested approach to solving a common architecture, design, or deployment task in a particular context.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
        </div>
        
		<p>The specification of your pattern describes the problem that is being addressed, why the problem is important (the value statement), and any constraints for the solution. Patterns typically emerge from common usage and the application of a particular product or technology.</p>		
		<p>Your pattern has values that are known as pattern parameters. The pattern parameters that your pattern users configure depend on the pattern and on the options the pattern author enables for this pattern. An example of a pattern parameter is a queue name from where messages are read. After the pattern users have configured the pattern parameters, the pattern users generate a Pattern Instance project, which is a WebSphere Message Broker project that contains a pattern instance configuration file. This configuration file stores the pattern parameters that the pattern user has configured. Generation also creates one or more additional WebSphere Message Broker projects that typically contain message flows and other WebSphere Message Broker resources that implement the pattern.</p>
