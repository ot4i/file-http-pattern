	<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the 
	<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern</h1>

<p class="shortdesc">A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
<p>You can use the 
<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern only if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>It must be possible to read the input file as comprising a number of individual records.</b><br/>
	Files can be processed if they contain fixed-length records, variable-length
	records that are separated by a well-known delimiter, or variable-length records that
	can be extracted by a parser; a technique referred to as 
	<span class="mftobjpropval">Parsed Record Sequence</span>. 
	You can use this technique to read a file
	that contains multiple XML documents, and return each document as a record.
	You cannot use this pattern to extract embedded records; 
	for example, records within a single XML document.</li><br/>
	<li><b>The integration node must be able to delete the source file.</b><br/>
	Source files are removed from their original location and moved to the integration node; they are not read in place.</li><br/>
	<li><b>The business function must be compatible with the redistribution of records after a system failure.</b><br/>
	This pattern distributes the records reliably, but does not guard against duplicate records after a system failure.</li><br/>
	<li><b>The business function must be compatible with the redistribution of records after a failure
	to read a record from the file, or to route a record to a destination.</b><br/>
	In this case, the whole file is moved to the backout directory<!-- and an error is written to the
	error queue-->. You must arrange for the file to be resubmitted after the error is corrected.
	When a file is resubmitted, all the records in the file are reprocessed, which might mean that the HTTP web service receives duplicate 
	records.</li>
	<!-- <li>If logging is required, the format that is used by this pattern is assumed 
	to meet the requirements of your own environment.</li> -->
</ul>
