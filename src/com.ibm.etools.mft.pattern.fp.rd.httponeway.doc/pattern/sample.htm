<body id="com.ibm.etools.mft.pattern.fp.rd.httponeway.sample">
	<h1 class="topictitle1">Using the sample data with the 
	<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">If you want to test the pattern without creating your own input data and HTTP web service, 
	you can use the sample data that is provided with the pattern. When you select a sample configuration, the required 
	parameters are automatically completed with values that match the sample data.</p>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> To run the HTTP web services that are provided with the pattern, you must have the Node.js runtime environment installed on your computer. The 
	Node.js runtime environment can be downloaded from the <span>Node.js web site: <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/" title="Node.js web site">http://nodejs.org/download/</a></span>.
	</p> 

	<p>There are two sample configurations available with the <span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern.
	</p>
	
	<p>If you select <b>Single Destination</b> as the sample configuration, then the records that are extracted from the files are all sent 
	to the Default web service.</p>
	<p>If you select <b>Specific routing</b> as the sample configuration, then the records that are extracted from the files are 
	examined before they are routed to a web service:
		<ul>
			<li>If the Country field in the record is set to "United Kingdom", the record is routed to the UK web service.</li>
			<li>If the Country field in the record is set to "United States", the record is routed to the US web service.</li>
			<li>If the Country field in the record is not set to "United Kingdom" or "United States", 
			the record is routed to the Default web service.</li>	
		</ul>		
	You can extend this sample configuration by adding additional routing configurations.</p>
	
	<p>The following sample resources are created when you generate the application from the pattern:
	<ul>
		<li>An input directory where you add the files to be processed by the application:
			<ul><li>On Windows: <span class="filepath"><tt><i>temp_dir</i>\file_to_http_sample</tt></span></li>
			<li>On Linux: <span class="filepath"><tt><i>temp_dir</i>/file_to_http_sample</tt></span></li></ul>
			where <i>temp_dir</i> is your operating system's temporary directory.</li><br/>
		<li>Three sample files that contain user records:
			<ul><li>One record has a Country field set to "United Kingdom".</li>
			<li>One record has a Country field set to "United States".</li>
			<li>One record has a Country field set to "Canada".</li></ul></li><br/>
		<li>A Node.js web server with three web services available from the following URLs:
			<ul><li>UK web service: <tt>http://localhost:<i>port</i>/country/uk.html</tt></li>
			<li>US web service: <tt>http://localhost:<i>port</i>/country/us.html</tt></li>
			<li>Default web service: <tt>http://localhost:<i>port</i>/country/default.html</tt></li></ul></li>
			
			where <i>port</i> is an available port. By default the port will be <tt>3000</tt>, unless this port is not available.
	</ul>
