	<h1 class="topictitle1">Tasks to complete before you generate the 
	<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Before you generate a pattern instance, you must 
complete the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirm that this pattern meets the business requirements and can be supported by both the system that creates the files
and by the destination HTTP web services.</li>
<li>Identify the purpose of the pattern application and give the pattern instance an appropriate
name.</li>
<!-- <li>Decide whether you require logging. If logging is required, you must decide to which queue manager and 
queue the logging messages are sent. Logging might be to a general log queue, 
which already exists 
for other broker flows or to a queue that is created for the pattern instance.</li>-->
<!-- <li>Decide whether you require error messages. 
If error messages are required, you must decide to which queue manager and 
queue the error messages are sent.</li> -->
<li>Decide how records are detected and, if required, prepare a message model to define how records
are parsed. For more information, search for "Recognizing file records as messages to be parsed" in the IBM Integration Bus documentation.</li>
<li>Decide whether validation is required and, if required, prepare a message set to define how
records are parsed. For more information, search for "Validating messages" in the IBM Integration Bus documentation.</li>
<li>Determine whether the files that are to be processed are local or remote. If remote files are to
be processed, identify the name of the FtpServer configurable service. For more information, search for "FtpServer configurable service" in the 
IBM Integration Bus documentation.</li>
<li>Determine the number of possible destinations for a record:<ul>
<li>If there is only one destination, set the
<span class="msobjprop"><i>Routing</i></span> parameter to <span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Single Destination</tt></b></span> and supply 
the HTTP web service URL of the destination.</li>
<li>If there is more than one destination, set the
<span class="msobjprop"><i>Routing</i></span> parameter to <span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Specify
Routes</tt></b></span> and define the routing rules and destinations.</li>
<!-- <li>If the set of target routes is not fully determined or might change
	frequently, set the <span class="msobjprop">Routing</span> parameter to 
	<span class="msobjpropval">Lookup routes</span>. If this value is
	selected, the name of the data source must be known.</li> -->
</ul>
