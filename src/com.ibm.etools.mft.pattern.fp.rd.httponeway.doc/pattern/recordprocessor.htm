<p class="shortdesc">Details about the RecordProcessor subflow for the 
	<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> pattern. </p>
	<p>By default, this subflow has no impact. 
	When the <span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> 
	pattern is used to generate a pattern instance, 
	the RecordProcessor subflow contains only a Passthrough node. 
	This subflow is included to provide a place where a pattern instance
	can be customized by using standard tools, 
	without changing the structure of the pattern.</p>
