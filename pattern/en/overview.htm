<div>
	<p class="shortdesc">Use the <span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> 
	pattern to connect file-based and transaction-based styles of integration. </p>
	
	<p>Use this pattern in the following situations: <ul>
<li>You have batches of transactions that are received as files from local or remote systems.</li>
<li>Your transactions cannot be sent as individual transactions. For example:
<ul>
	<li>The source systems support file-based integration capabilities only.</li>
	<li>The business requirements mandate that transactions are batched; for example, the collection 
	of all transactions within a working day.</li>
	<li>You must conform to existing working practices; for example, you must use files that contain EDI
	transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your target systems are designed to accept individual transactions. Such systems might take
input from near real-time systems and from batch files, and therefore present a transactional
interface.</li>
<li>You have batch files that contain transactions that must be distributed to one or more
systems.</li>
<li>If any failures occur, it must be acceptable for the entire file to be reprocessed.
</li>
</ul></p>

	<h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
</div>
<p>The solution is to implement a message flow that reads records from a file and routes each record to one
of the following destinations:
<ul>
<li>An HTTP web service that is defined in the routing rules.</li>
<li>A default destination, if a matching HTTP web service is not found in the routing rules.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div>

		alt="A diagram showing the behavior of the pattern service requests are forwarded to the end service provider." />
</div>
<p>If you do not have the prerequisite resources in your environment, the pattern contains sample data that you 
can use for test purposes. The sample data includes a Node.js web service. To run the web service you must have 
the Node.js runtime environment installed on your computer. 
The Node.js runtime environment can be downloaded from the <span>Node.js web site: <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/" title="Node.js web site">http://nodejs.org/download/</a></span>.
