	<h1 class="topictitle1">Route subflow for the Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way pattern</h1>
<p class="shortdesc">Details about the Route subflow for the 
	<span>Record Distribution to HTTP: one-way</span> 
	pattern. </p>

<p>The behavior of the Route subflow depends on the value of the 
<span class="msobjprop"><i>Routing</i></span> pattern 
parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Single Destination</tt></b></span>
<p>If you select <span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Single Destination</tt></b></span>, then 
a single HTTPRequest node is created and 
configured with the values of the <span class="msobjprop"><i>Web Service URL</i></span> 
pattern parameter. The routing flow is a subflow that includes a Passthrough node. 
Both default and route terminals are included so that this subflow 
is consistent with all other types of routing subflow, 
but only the single route terminal is used.
</p></li>


<li><span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Specify Routes</tt></b></span>
<p>If you select <span class="msobjpropval"><b><tt>Specify Routes</tt></b></span>, then you must define at least one route.</p>
<p>To define a route, assign values to the following group of three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="msobjprop"><i>Key Location: </i></span>
An XPath expression that defines a key location within the current message element. 
For more information about the type of expression to use, 
see "Route node" and "Using XPath" in the IBM Integration Bus documentation.</li>
<li><span class="msobjprop"><i>Key Value: </i></span>
A value that must match the key location if this route is taken.</li>
<li><span class="msobjprop"><i>Web Service URL: </i></span>
The URL of an HTTP web service that can process the message.</li>

</ul>
<p>For each route that is defined, an Output terminal for the Route subflow and an HTTPRequest node
are created and connected.</p>
<p>The Route subflow contains a Route node that is configured with a filter that routes 
to the first Output terminal for which the condition <tt>Key Location = Key Value</tt> is true.
If a message element does not match any of the routes, this situation is recorded in a
variable in the integration node environment tree, and the message is passed to the Default terminal.</p>
<p>If the XPath expression that defines a <span class="msobjprop"><b><tt>Key Location</tt></b></span> includes a
namespace qualifier, the tag that defines the namespace must be added to the Namespace table.</p>

<p>You might see a warning on the Route node that is similar to the following message:</p>
 <p><tt>Filter table: Filter pattern: The <var>element_name</var> schema element was not found in the 
 <span class="msobjpropval">Key Location = Key Value</span> XPath.</tt></p>
 <p>This warning does not cause any problems when you deploy and run your pattern instance.</p>
